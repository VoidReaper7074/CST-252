		<h1> Challenges </h1>

		<p1> This lab tasked us to repeat the example loop that we did in class with a few added else if statements. We created an html site, wrote our function following the lecture example and we were left with a function that checks if the numbers between 1-200 are factors of 3, 5, 7 and their combinations.

		<h2> Problems</h2>

		<p2> Ran into a few issues with getting our function to output, and symtax errors.
