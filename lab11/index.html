		<h1> Challenges </h1>

		<p1>  This lab was our intro to conditionals. We were to create the function sortingHat(str) in order to cound the letters in a string and assign it to a variabe.
			We then took that variable and used a % operator to find a remainder of 4. Once we had that value, we created a conditional that would return a Hogwarts House for the user to be sorted into.
		We got the users input using a form and an event listener attached to a button to that run the function using said input.

		<p3>  At the bottom of my page you can find a link to my source code and a link to my homepage. Above them is the division I have set for my input field and the button that runs my function.  If you enter your name and click the button,
	you your name will be taken, counted and assigned a value that corresponds to your new Hogwarts House assignment. </p3>
